# Learning System Redesign

A scalable redesign of a traditional instructor-led course into a modular, learner-centered system optimized for motivation, cognitive efficiency, and applied skill development.

## Product Context

This redesign shifts from linear content delivery to structured progression and scaffolded practice. The system architecture is optimized to balance learner autonomy with predictable pacing under fixed-term and resource constraints.

## Design Framework

- Predictable modular sequencing  
- Scaffolded skill development aligned to progression states  
- Early formative feedback to support self-regulation  
- Clear system signaling to reinforce momentum and confidence  

## Product Capabilities

- Interactive legacy vs. redesigned system comparison  
- Expandable module architecture  
- Dynamic learning indicators reflecting structural impact
